🌱 EcoAQI
Green AI–Based City-Level Air Quality Monitoring & Prediction

EcoAQI is a Green AI–driven air quality monitoring system that predicts city-level Air Quality Index (AQI) using lightweight, explainable machine learning models.
The project focuses on energy-efficient computation, transparency, and actionable health insights, making it suitable for environmental monitoring and policy support.


🚀 Why EcoAQI?

Most existing AQI platforms:

- Work as black-box systems

- Require heavy computation

- Focus on large-scale averages

EcoAQI is different.

It is designed to be:

✅ Explainable – shows why AQI changes

✅ Energy-efficient (Green AI) – lightweight ML models

✅ City-focused – useful at local decision level

✅ Action-oriented – links AQI levels to health impact & actions


🧠 What Does This Project Do?

EcoAQI:

1. Takes weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)

2. Uses historical ground AQI data

3. Predicts the AQI score

4. Explains which factors influence AQI

5. Suggests health impacts and recommended actions

6. Displays results using an interactive Streamlit dashboard
